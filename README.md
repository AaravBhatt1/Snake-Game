# Snake-Game
This is a basic snake game written by me when I was 13 years old. The comments in the code are written by me now (as I am uploading this project).
It uses concepts from both OOP and FP such as inheritance from OOP and recursion from FP (although I didn't know about FP at the time i wrote this).
